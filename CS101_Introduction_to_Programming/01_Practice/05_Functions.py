# Write a function named tenth_power() that has one parameter named num.

# The function should return num raised to the 10th power.

# Uncomment these function calls to test your tenth_power function:
#print(tenth_power(1))
# 1 to the 10th power is 1
#print(tenth_power(0))
# 0 to the 10th power is 0
#print(tenth_power(2))
# 2 to the 10th power is 1024

# Write a function named square_root() that has one parameter named num.

# Use exponents (**) to return the square root of num.

def square_root(num):

# Uncomment these function calls to test your square_root function:
#print(square_root(16))
# should print 4

# Create a function called win_percentage() that takes two parameters named wins and losses.

# This function should return out the total percentage of games won by a team based on these two numbers.

def win_percentage(wins, losses):

# Uncomment these function calls to test your win_percentage function:
#print(win_percentage(5, 5))

# Write a function named average() that has two parameters named num1 and num2.

# The function should return the average of these two numbers.

# Uncomment these function calls to test your average function:
#print(average(1, 100))
# The average of 1 and 100 is 50.5
#print(average(1, -1))
# The average of 1 and -1 is 0
# Uncomment these function calls to test your average function:

# The average of 1 and 100 is 50.5
#print(average(1, -1))
# The average of 1 and -1 is 0

# Write a function named remainder() that has two parameters named num1 and num2.

# The function should return the remainder of twice num1 divided by half of num2.
