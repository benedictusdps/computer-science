# Write a function called check_for_name that takes two strings as parameters named sentence and name. 
# The function should return True if name appears in sentence in all lowercase letters, all uppercase letters, or with any mix of uppercase and lowercase letters. 
# The function should return False otherwise.

# should print True
#print(check_for_name("My name is Samantha", "Jamie"))

# Write a function called make_spoonerism that takes two strings as parameters named word1 and word2. Finding the first syllable of a word is a difficult task, so for our function, weâ€™re going to switch the first letters of each word. Return the two new words as a single string separated by a space.

# Create a function named add_exclamation that has one parameter named word. This function should add exclamation points to the end of word until word is 20 characters long. If word is already at least 20 characters long, just return word.
